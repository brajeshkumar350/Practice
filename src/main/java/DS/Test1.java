/*

Reverse a string without affecting special characters. Given a string, that contains a special character together with alphabets (‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’), reverse the string in a way that special characters are not affected.
Examples:
Input:   str = "a,b$c"
Output:  str = "c,b$a"
Note that $ and , are not moved anywhere.
Only subsequence "abc" is reversed
Input:   str = "Ab,c,de!$"
Output:  str = "ed,c,bA!$"
